            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Nyanchama Obara, a Front-End Engineer with a passion for creating user-friendly web applications. My journey in tech blends a strong foundation in Information Security with a keen interest in front-end development, allowing me to build intuitive, accessible, secure and engaging digital experiences.

I enjoy working where design meets technology — creating solutions that not only look polished but are also reliable, performant, and user-friendly. </p>

<p>
Currently, I’m growing my skills in software development while building projects like weather apps, portfolio sites, interactive music visualizers, vulnerability scanners and AI chatbots. My focus is on modern front-end tools and clean, thoughtful design. With a background in Information Security and Ethical Hacking, I bring a unique perspective that combines usability with strong foundations in safety and best practices.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I’ve had the opportunity to support IT operations at the Communications Authority of Kenya, gaining experience in troubleshooting, systems management, and technical support across diverse environments. These roles strengthened my ability to problem-solve and adapt technology to real-world needs.
</p>
<p>
Outside of work and coding, I’m usually exploring music theory (with the violin, viola, and piano), reading, or diving into creative projects that stretch both my technical and artistic sides.
